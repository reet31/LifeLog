LifeLog — A Personal Digital Journal & Life Tracker

LifeLog is a personal project I’m building to log daily life, moods, thoughts, and activities in a structured way instead of letting everything stay scattered across notes, chats, and memory.

This project is work in progress and is being developed incrementally, with regular updates pushed to GitHub.

🎯 Why LifeLog Exists (Real Reason)

Most journaling apps are either:

too bloated 

too aesthetic, zero function 

or locked behind paywalls 

LifeLog is different:

built for clarity over decoration

focuses on tracking + reflection

fully customizable because I control the code

This is not a startup pitch.
It’s a personal system that I’m engineering step by step.

🛠️Tech Stack

This will evolve as the project grows.

Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT-based auth
Version Control: Git & GitHub

✨ Current Features

✔️ Create diary entries
✔️ Store mood along with entries
✔️ Backend APIs for diary data
✔️ KPI / insights endpoint for mood counts
✔️ Project structured with models, routes, middleware


🚀 How I’m Working on This Project

Building one feature at a time

Pushing regular commits instead of dumping everything at once

Treating this as a long-term learning + portfolio project

Writing real backend logic instead of fake demo code

This repo reflects actual progress, not a polished final product.

📌 Status

🟡 Active Development
Expect frequent updates, refactors, and improvements.


🧠 LifeLog

LifeLog is a personal project I’m actively building to log and reflect on daily life — things like thoughts, habits, moods, and progress.
This is a work-in-progress project, and the repository shows my actual development journey, not a fake “finished” app.

I’m intentionally committing and pushing changes regularly to build discipline and improve as a developer.

✅ What I’ve built so far

At this stage, I have:

Set up the complete project structure from scratch

Initialized and configured the Git/GitHub workflow properly

Built the base logic/layout required for logging daily data

Organized the code to make future features easy to add

Started following a habit of small, consistent updates instead of big unfinished plans

This repo already reflects real effort and working code, not just boilerplate.

🧠 Why this project exists

I built LifeLog to:

Practice building a real project end-to-end

Improve consistency with Git commits and daily pushes

Learn by doing instead of just studying theory

Create something useful while improving my coding fundamentals

This project is as much about discipline and growth as it is about features.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: ReactJs,Node,MongoDB,EJS,CSS

Version Control: Git & GitHub

Editor/Tools: VS Code

Kept clarity over complexity.

🔄 How I’m developing it

My approach is straightforward:

One feature or improvement at a time

Clear, meaningful commit messages

Regular pushes to GitHub

Refactoring when I learn better ways to do things

The commit history is meant to show progress, not perfection.

🚧 What’s coming next

Planned improvements include:

Expanding daily logging features (mood, habits, notes)

Improving structure and validation

Better user flow / usability

Code cleanup and refactoring

Plans may change — execution won’t stop.

⚠️ Honest disclaimer

This project is:

Still evolving

Not optimized yet

Built as a learning-focused project

That’s intentional. The goal is to build consistently and get better over time.

🟢 Final note

This repository represents my commitment to showing up and building, even when the project isn’t “perfect yet.”
Updates will continue as the project grows
