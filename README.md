LifeLog — A Personal Digital Journal & Life Tracker

LifeLog is a personal project I’m building to log daily life, moods, thoughts, and activities in a structured way instead of letting everything stay scattered across notes, chats, and memory.

This project is work in progress and is being developed incrementally, with regular updates pushed to GitHub.

🎯 Why LifeLog Exists (Real Reason)

Most journaling apps are either:

too bloated 

too aesthetic, zero function 

or locked behind paywalls 

LifeLog is different:

built for clarity over decoration

focuses on tracking + reflection

fully customizable because I control the code

This is not a startup pitch.
It’s a personal system that I’m engineering step by step.

🚀 How I’m Working on This Project

Building one feature at a time

Pushing regular commits instead of dumping everything at once

Treating this as a long-term learning + portfolio project

Writing real backend logic instead of fake demo code

This repo reflects actual progress, not a polished final product.
